While at Wyncode, in Miami, FL, our first introduction into HTML and CSS including a project that was a Mock-up.  Each of the students was assigned a web page, hosted on AWS, and we were instructed to try and Copy the layout using the HTML and CSS that we had learned.  I can honestly say, we hadn't learned much, and this was a difficult project.  But, i learned how to use flex box, which was a skill that I am NOW very glad that I was forced to learn.  The code on this repo is ugly, and VERY wet.  I am leaving this repo up in github, for sentimental reasons, as well as a humbling reminder of my initial first steps into Coding.
